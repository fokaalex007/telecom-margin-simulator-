# 📊 Telecom Margin Simulator  
_A dynamic Excel-based model for pricing impact and margin analysis in telecom operations._

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project showcases a margin simulation tool built for a telecom analytics exercise. The goal was to help decision-makers understand how changes in mobile and landline pricing affect profitability across vendors, countries, and client types.

The model was designed in Excel to allow fast scenario testing, margin breakdowns, and strategic recommendations — all without requiring technical expertise.

## ⚙️ Features  
- Adjustable input boxes for mobile and landline rates  
- Real-time margin recalculation across multiple dimensions  
- Pivot tables for vendor, country, and client segmentation  
- Visual charts for margin trends and performance flags  
- Clean layout for executive review and rapid iteration

## 📁 Files Included  
- `raw_billing_data.xlsx`: Original anonymized billing data  
- `cleaned_margin_model.xlsx`: Final simulation tool with formulas and visuals  
- `/images`: Screenshots of dashboard views and pivot logic

## 📈 Use Case  
This tool was used in a real-world telecom pricing exercise to:
- Identify high-margin vendor-country combinations  
- Flag underperforming segments  
- Support pricing decisions with clear, data-driven insights

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
- Microsoft Excel (formulas, pivot tables, slicers)  
- PowerPoint (summary deck for stakeholder presentation)

## 🔒 Ethical Note  
Out of respect for client confidentiality, the company name and proprietary identifiers have been omitted. Client IDs are anonymized and do not contain any personally identifiable information. This simulation reflects the logic and structure of the original project using representative data.
